<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn>data integrity proof</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of attributes that represent a digital proof and the parameters required
to verify it.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>public key</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Cryptographic material that can be used to verify digital proofs created with a
corresponding <a>private key</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>private key</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Cryptographic material that can be used to generate digital proofs.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>proof type</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives bundled together into a
<a>cryptographic suite</a> for the purposes of safety and convenience, by
cryptographers for developers (see the section on 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#cryptographic-suites">cryptographic suites</a>).
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>proof options</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of options that is included in the proof data. These options might
include <a>controller</a>, <a>challenge</a>, <a>domain</a>, or other data
that is specific to the proof format.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>proof purpose</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The specific intent for the proof; the reason why an entity created it. The
protected declaration acts as a safeguard to prevent the proof from being
misused for a purpose other than the one it was intended for.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>challenge</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A random or pseudo-random value used by some authentication protocols to
mitigate replay attacks.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>domain</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A string value that specifies the operational domain of a digital proof.
This could be an Internet domain name like <code>example.com</code>, an
ad-hoc value such as <code>mycorp-level3-access</code>, or a very
specific transaction value like <code>8zF6T8J34qP3mqP</code>. A signer could
include a <a>domain</a> in its digital proof to restrict its use
to particular target, identified by the specified <a>domain</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="authenticated|authenticate">authentication</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A process by which an entity can prove to a verifier that it has a specific
attribute or controls a specific secret.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="cryptosuite">cryptographic suite</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A specification defining the usage of specific cryptographic primitives in
order to achieve a particular security goal. These documents are often used
to specify <a>verification methods</a>, digital signature types,
their identifiers, and other related properties.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn> (DID)</dt>

  <dd>
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
registration authority and is often generated and/or registered
cryptographically. The generic format of a is defined in [[DID-CORE]]. Many—but
not all—methods make use of <a>distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) or some
other form of decentralized network.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="controller(s)">controller</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
An entity that has the capability to make changes to a
<a>controller document</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="controller documents">controller document</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A set of data that specifies one or more relationships between a
<a>controller</a> and a set of data, such as a set of public cryptographic keys.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects">subject</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The entity identified by the `id` property in a <a>controller document</a>.
Anything can be a subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital
thing, logical thing, etc.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="distributed ledger technology|DLT">distributed ledger</dfn> (DLT)</dt>

  <dd>
A non-centralized system for recording events. These systems establish
sufficient confidence for participants to rely upon the data recorded by others
to make operational decisions. They typically use distributed databases where
different nodes use a consensus protocol to confirm the ordering of
cryptographically signed transactions. The linking of digitally signed
transactions over time often makes the history of the ledger effectively
immutable.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="resources">resource</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
As defined by [[RFC3986]]: "...the term 'resource' is used in a general sense
for whatever might be identified by a URI." Similarly, any resource might serve
as a <a>subject</a> identified by a <a>DID</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifier|verifiers|verifier's">verifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an entity performs by receiving data containing one or more
<a>data integrity proofs</a> and then determining whether or not the proof
is valid.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable
digital credentials as defined by the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification
[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2]].
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">verification method</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>
A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
    </p>
    <p>
"Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
"verification" or "proof."
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">verification relationship</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>
An expression of the relationship between the <a>subject</a> and a
<a>verification method</a>. An example of a verification relationship is
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#cryptographic-suites#authentication">authentication</a>.
    </p>
